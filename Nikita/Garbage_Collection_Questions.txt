Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?
Ans:     The important role of garbage collection in java is automatic memory genration,means when we allocate memory to program in native language like C and C++ we have to free memory by ourself(by programer) and in this language there is some drow back like memory leak ,so in java this work is done by Garbage collection,thats why garbage collection is important in java .

12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?
Ans: In C and C++ free the memory by programer so C and C++ are compile fast,but in java this memmory management work is done by Garbage collector so while executing garbage collector all program is stop and take time to exicute so this is drowback of this Garbage Collection it make language slow.

13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?
Ans: in Garbage collection there are type young ,old and permanent ,so firstly garbage collector go to young gen. there is two part enum,surviver so garbage collector go to enum and check this variable is reacheble or not if it is reacheble mark that variable when enum part is full it's go S0 part and follow the same like enum.

14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?
Ans :In stack memory follow LIFO rule means Last In First Out. In heap memory we store reffrance of this variable.
15. Write a Stack Program.
