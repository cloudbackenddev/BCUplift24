
1. What is the purpose of the Java Garbage Collector?

   b) JVM Compiler
   c) Runtime Data Area
   d) Bytecode Verifier

Answere - c

3. How does the Garbage Collector determine if an object is eligible for garbage collection?
   a) By checking if the object is reachable
   b) By examining the object's reference count
   c) By the size of the object
   d) By the object's creation time

Answere - a

   a) Stack
   b) Heap
   c) Cache
   d) Register

Answere - d

   c) Infant Generation
   d) Permanent Generation

Answere - c

7. What is a "stop-the-world" event in the context of Garbage Collection?
   a) A situation where the Garbage Collector runs concurrently with the application
   b) A situation where the application is paused while Garbage Collection is performed
   c) A situation where an object is pinned in memory
   d) A situation where Garbage Collection never occurs

Answere - b

8. What is the purpose of the "System.gc()" method in Java?
   a) To explicitly trigger garbage collection
   b) To increase memory allocation for the JVM
   c) To reduce the memory footprint of an application
   d) To start a new JVM instance

Answere - a

9. Which garbage collection algorithm is typically used for the Young Generation in the JVM?
   a) Mark-and-Sweep
   b) Generational Garbage Collection
   c) Parallel Garbage Collection
   d) Concurrent Garbage Collection

Answere - a

10. In the context of Garbage Collection, what is the PermGen (Permanent Generation) used for?
    a) Storing live objects
    b) Storing the heap
    c) Storing class metadata, such as classes and methods
    d) Managing thread pools

Answere - c

Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?

Answere - Garbage Collection is important in java because when we create a Object that time it's go to heap and it's take alot unnecessary space so for clean for it java needs GC.
 
12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?

13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?

Answere - When GC works and it's divide into two phase first is mark and second is sweep. Mark will mark all unreachle values and after that it clean all mark values it's clean sweep.

14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?
Answere - Stack, it is used for a specific size and it's store primitative data types.
	  Heap, it is flexiable in size and its's store non-primitative data types

15. Write a Stack Program.
