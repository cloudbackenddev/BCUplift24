   d) Bytecode Verifier


Ans:- c


3. How does the Garbage Collector determine if an object is eligible for garbage collection?
   a) By checking if the object is reachable
   b) By examining the object's reference count

   b) Old Generation
   c) Infant Generation
   d) Permanent Generation


Ans:- c


7. What is a "stop-the-world" event in the context of Garbage Collection?
   a) A situation where the Garbage Collector runs concurrently with the application
   b) A situation where the application is paused while Garbage Collection is performed
   c) A situation where an object is pinned in memory
   d) A situation where Garbage Collection never occurs


Ans:-b


8. What is the purpose of the "System.gc()" method in Java?
   a) To explicitly trigger garbage collection
   b) To increase memory allocation for the JVM
   c) To reduce the memory footprint of an application
   d) To start a new JVM instance


Ans:-




9. Which garbage collection algorithm is typically used for the Young Generation in the JVM?
   a) Mark-and-Sweep
   b) Generational Garbage Collection
   c) Parallel Garbage Collection
   d) Concurrent Garbage Collection


Ans:-a


10. In the context of Garbage Collection, what is the PermGen (Permanent Generation) used for?
    a) Storing live objects
    b) Storing the heap
    c) Storing class metadata, such as classes and methods
    d) Managing thread pools
Ans:-c




Subjective Questions:


11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?


Ans:-  To free the heap memory for performing more operations it is necessary to free memory. Garbage collector find which objects or variables are reachable and which are not. Those variables are unreachable garbage collector remove them from memory and free the memory.


12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?
Ans:-Sometimes it cleans useful variables also. And it’s performed operations on heap tha’s why the performance of the code will be a little bit slow.


13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?


Ans:- Mark and Sweep means the garbage collector identifies which variables are reachable and which are not. If reachable variables are found, then mark those variables. And if unreachable variables are found, it sweeps those variables.


14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?


Ans:- Stack stores the local variables,  for sometimes not permanently, it has faster access, and heap stores global variables , variables and it allocates memory at dynamically type. and it has slower access.
