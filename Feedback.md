If you want to access directly you need to use protected modifier in abstract class <br/>-  If you want to call super on parent class you need to pass attributes for that constructor. In this case accountNumber and balance<br/> Use real type date for customer dob                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Functionality was incomplete also . Must read more about how classes interact with each other . Must also read on Java standards and access modifiers

Code didnt compiled but the approach is good.<br/>Code formatting is good<br/>- Naming convention is good<br/>Access modifiers are ok.<br/>- Customer class has performTransaction function missing because of which code didnt compiled. Moreover the performTransaction method should be in Account class and not in Customer class<br/>- Customer and account class variables should have its getters and setters which is missing<br/>- System.out.println is not been used correctly which gives compilation error.<br/>- Logic is ok and understanding of the problem is there. With little more effort this problem can be solved.<br/>

Well done<br/>- Code formatting is good<br/>- Naming convention is good<br/>- Access modifiers are upto mark.<br/>- Code complied but the output was partially correct.<br/>- Customer class is created but was not part of either saving or current account which was one of the main requirement<br/>- createTransaction, printTransactions have empty method bodies, logic missing<br/>- Transaction not part of deposit/withdraw methods of the account.<br/>- Logic is ok but the requirement is not correctly captured in code. Code compiled but need to give more focus on understanding of requiremet. Over all good

Code compiled after fixing a typo.<br/>- Code formatting is good<br/>- Naming convention is good<br/>- Access modifiers are good.<br/>- Transaction requirement is not implemented. <br/>- getAccountNumber is missing return statement rather printing the account number.<br/>- In current account overdraft amount is hardcoded. Ideally it should be part of current account instance variables<br/>- import javax.swing.plaf.basic.BasicBorders.RadioButtonBorder - Not sure why this import was used.<br/>- Over all good code quality apart from a typo and barring missing transaction implemntation code looks clean

Hence the deposit and withdraw feature itself is missing<br/>- Transaction feature is not implemented.<br/>- Overall good try, but requirement not captured properly in code. Concept of abstarct class should be studied again
