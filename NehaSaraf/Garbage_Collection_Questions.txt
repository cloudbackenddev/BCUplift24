Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?

Ans:- Garbage collection is necessary in java.it provide Automatic memory Management.Garbage collection also prevent lack of memory.

12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?

Ans:-sometime it take time for execution.

13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?

Ans:-	 Mark and sweep is an algorithum. Mark-and-sweep algorithum is one of 	the best algorithum known for the Garbage collection algorithum.

	this algorithum has two phase:1)Mark 2)Sweep

	1) Mark:
	2) Sweep:

14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?

Ans:-
	1) stack is linear type of data Structure.and Heap is non-liner type of data Structure.
	2)it is in a fixed Size and Heap can shrink or grow in run-time.
	3)In Stack memory allocation is fast. in Heap memory allocation in Slow.
	4)In stack variable Store in Static memory and Heap variable Store in Dynamic memory. 
	Stack is contiguous memory and Heap is not contiguous memory.



15. Write a Stack Program.

Ans:-
