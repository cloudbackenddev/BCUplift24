    d) Managing thread pools

ans:  c) Storing class metadata, such as classes and methods

Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?
	Answer: While executing a program objects get created in heap memory and the objects which are not in use or the unreachable objects are taking more spaces in heap memory so memory gets full to avoid this there is a concept of Garbage collection in java. When there is reassigning of variables or use of unreachable objects Garbage collector is automatically gets called hence known as automatic memory management.It makes the program more efficient avoid overuse of memory spaces.

	
12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?
	Answer: 


13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?
	Answer: Marking and sweep these are the two methods in Garbage collection in java. During the execution of a program when variables got initialized during program these two steps mark and sweep is done in eden by which unreachable objects get removed and reachable objects are moved to survivor.

 
14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?
	Answer: Stack is a linear data structure in which memory allocation is static and in heap memory allocation is dyanamic.Primitive variables like int,float,char, double, boolean, short, long are stored in stack whereas reference type variables like String, Date are stored in heap.  
objects in heap have slower access wheres in stack they have faster access. Heap objects are long lived whereas stack objects are short lived.In heap dynamic memory allocation is done at runtime and in stack it is done at compile time.
