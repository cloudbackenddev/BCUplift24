Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?
Ans :- Grabage collection is necessary in java beacuase of memory management. It performs very important role . It removes the memory for unusable objects and free the memory for other objects. So it handles the memory is handled.
12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?
Ans :- The drawback for the garbage colletion sometimes it takes time for execution. 
13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?
14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?
Answer :- Stack is a linear data structure based on LIFO principle .stack is fixed size .It allows automatic memory allocation.Stack store short term memory.Stack is faster than heap .
	Heap is fragmented sturcture .It has dyanmic memory allocation.Heap is slower than stack.It stores long lived memory.S
15. Write a Stack Program.
