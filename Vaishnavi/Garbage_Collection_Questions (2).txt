
1. What is the purpose of the Java Garbage Collector?
   a) To allocate memory for objects
   b) To release memory occupied by unused objects
   c) To optimize code execution
   d) To manage database connections

Ans = b

2. Which part of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is responsible for garbage collection?
   a) Class Loader
   b) JVM Compiler
   c) Runtime Data Area
   d) Bytecode Verifier

Ans = c

3. How does the Garbage Collector determine if an object is eligible for garbage collection?
   a) By checking if the object is reachable
   b) By examining the object's reference count
   c) By the size of the object
   d) By the object's creation time

Ans = b

4. Which of the following are Java Garbage Collection algorithms?
   a) Stack-based algorithm
   b) Mark-and-Sweep
   c) Bubble Sort
   d) Depth-First Search

Ans = b

5. In Java, which part of the memory is managed by the Garbage Collector?
   a) Stack
   b) Heap
   c) Cache
   d) Register

Ans = b

6. Which of the following is not a generation in the generational garbage collection model?
   a) Young Generation
   b) Old Generation
   c) Infant Generation
   d) Permanent Generation

Ans = c

7. What is a "stop-the-world" event in the context of Garbage Collection?
   a) A situation where the Garbage Collector runs concurrently with the application
   b) A situation where the application is paused while Garbage Collection is performed
   c) A situation where an object is pinned in memory
   d) A situation where Garbage Collection never occurs

Ans = b

8. What is the purpose of the "System.gc()" method in Java?
   a) To explicitly trigger garbage collection
   b) To increase memory allocation for the JVM
   c) To reduce the memory footprint of an application
   d) To start a new JVM instance

Ans = a

9. Which garbage collection algorithm is typically used for the Young Generation in the JVM?
   a) Mark-and-Sweep
   b) Generational Garbage Collection
   c) Parallel Garbage Collection
   d) Concurrent Garbage Collection

Ans = a

10. In the context of Garbage Collection, what is the PermGen (Permanent Generation) used for?
    a) Storing live objects
    b) Storing the heap
    c) Storing class metadata, such as classes and methods
    d) Managing thread pools

Ans = c


Subjective Questions:

11. Why Garbage Collection is necessary in Java?
Ans = To delete the object which lost their reference. It takes the memory form head area. To delete the object which is unused.

12. What is the drawback to Garbage Collection?
Ans = When Garbage collection is activate then application is paused while Garbage Collection is performed. It impact on performance of jvm.
 
13. What do you mean by mark-and-sweep?
Ans = Mark and sweep it is an algorithm. Marking is used  to mark the object which has no longer reference and it delete the object after marking, remove this object form heap memory. Sweep means after marking the usused object, it sweeps the used object in survivor which has a space. Its alternately, sweep form survivor s0 and s1. After sweep the object gets age after easy sweeping.

14. What is the difference between Heap and Stack in Java?
Ans = 
Heap : Heap is a Dynamically allocated memory used to store non-premitive data-types like String, ArrayList,Object.To clear the heap memory we need of garbage collector. Object creation is happen in heap.

Stack : Stack is used to store the premitive data-types like int,float,double. It is store in RAM. As soon as program finished all variable and methods remove form the stack.Object reference store in stack. All thread are make in stack. For each thread a separate memory for stack is allocated. Thread means nothing but the information about the method. 

15. Write a Stack Program.
